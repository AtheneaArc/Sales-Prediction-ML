# **Sales Prediction ML Project**

## **Description**
This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to predict retail sales. The goal is to showcase skills in predictive modeling, data analysis, and business-oriented problem-solving. Using historical sales data, the model provides insights into:
- Sales predictions for inventory management.
- Impact analysis of promotions and discounts.
- Revenue optimization by product category or customer segment.

The results are visualized in an **interactive dashboard** created with Power BI or Tableau.

|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Data Collection**    | Load the dataset into the project folder. Verify data format and structure.                     | `data/`                                         |
| **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Analyze the dataset to understand key features, distributions, and trends. Create visualizations for insights. | `notebooks/sales_analysis.ipynb`               |
| **3. Data Cleaning**      | Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data.                                   | `notebooks/cleaning_steps.ipynb` / `scripts/`  |
| **4. Feature Engineering**| Create new features or transform existing ones for better predictive power.                     | `notebooks/feature_engineering.ipynb` / `scripts/` |
| **5. Data Splitting**     | Split the data into training and testing sets.                                                  | `scripts/data_preprocessing.py`                |
| **6. Model Training**     | Train regression models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) using the training set.                  | `scripts/model_training.py`, `models/`         |
| **7. Model Evaluation**   | Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, or R².                                | `notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb`             |
| **8. Model Saving**       | Save the trained model for reuse.                                                              | `models/sales_prediction_model.pkl`            |
