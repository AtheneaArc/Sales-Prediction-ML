Description: 
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict retail sales. The model is trained with historical data using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The results are visualized in an interactive dashboard created with Power BI or Tableau. The goal is to showcase skills in predictive modeling and data analysis.

## Project Structure
data/: Contains the datasets in .csv format.
models/: Stores the trained models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
scripts/: Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling.
visualizations/: Charts and visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Required Libraries
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
xgboost
